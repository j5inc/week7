# Project 7 - WordPress Pentesting

Time spent: Approximately 4 hours.

> Objective: Find, analyze, recreate, and document **five vulnerabilities** affecting an old version of WordPress

## Pentesting Report

1. Large File Upload Error XSS
  - [X] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability type: XSS
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.15
  - [X] GIF Walkthrough:  ![](Attack1.gif)
  - [X] Steps to recreate: 
     -We need to create a file that is 20 MB or larger. The file name should have the payload script embedded in it.      Example file ~26MB: uploadme<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.png  
     -The next goal would be to trick an admin of the site to upload the file into the site.  
     -Since the file is larger than 20MB, WordPress reads the file name and executes the script that is embedded.  
     -Report found in WPScan: https://hackerone.com/reports/203515

2. Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting  
  - [X] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability type: XSS, CVE-2015-3440
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1
  - [X] GIF Walkthrough:  ![](Attack2.gif) 
  - [X] Steps to recreate:    
        -Post a comment wtih HTML tags and some type of script. It is important to note that the comment must be                     larger than 64KB.  
       -Example snippit:  
        HTML
        <a title='xxx onmouseover=alert(unescape(/this%20is%20bad/.source))             style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;height:5000px  XXXXXXXX...(50k X's to ensure 64KB...XXXXX'></a>

3. WordPress User Enumeration
  - [X] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability type: User Enumeration
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: It is unclear to me when this type of enumeration was patched. One way to fix this is to apply a plugin that outputs a better message when an invalid username/password combo is entered. 
  - [X] GIF Walkthrough:  ![](Attack3.gif)  
  - [X] Steps to recreate:  We can enumerate in this version by simply trying username and password combos. As you can see, in the GIF, when I put in invalid usernames it says "Invalid Username". As soon as I do a valid username with an incorrect password, we are given: "The password you entered for the username enumtestuser is incorrect". By automating something like this, a hacker could potentially guess a valid username.
  
  - [X] Affected source code:  I was not able to locate the exact code responsible. I did find a plugin called "Unified Login Error Messgages" that outputs the message "Invalid username/password combination" when a valid username is entered.
    
4. Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  - [X] Summary:  
    - Vulnerability types: XSS
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.13
  - [X] GIF Walkthrough:  ![](Attack4.gif) 
  - [X] Steps to recreate:  -Make a post on WordPress using a shortcode YouTube link with embedded script.  -The account will need to be at least a contributor.  -To avoid input validation, use \x3c and \x3e as the Javascript escape characters. -Example:  [embed src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/JuYeHPFR3f0\x3csvg onload=alert(1)\x3e'][/embed]

## Notes

One of the challenges I faced is having an older computer. My MacBook has 4GB of RAM and is limiting my ability to seamlessly switch between virtual environments.
